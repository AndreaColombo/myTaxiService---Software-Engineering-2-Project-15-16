\section{Risks}

In this section we will analyze risks that may occur during and after the development.

\subsection{Project Risks}

\begin{description}
	\item[Requirements Change:] Requirements may change during the project lifecycle. For example new features may be requested by the customer. (Marginal)
	\item[Lack of Skill:] Cruise skill may be not high enough and could delay the delivery. (Negligible)
\end{description}

\subsection{Technical Risks}

\begin{description}
	\item[Bugs in the code:] There may be some bugs in the code that haven't been identified. (Marginal)
	\item[Integration Test Failure:] After the implementation of the components, they may not pass the integration phase. (Critical)
	\item[Downtime:] System might go down for any reason, for example excessive load and hardware failure. (Critical)
	\item[Data Loss:] Data might be lost due to hardware failure and bugs. (Critical)
\end{description}

\subsection{Business Risks}
\begin{description}
	\item[Market risk:] People could not be interested in using our app, preferring traditional method.
	\item[Competitors:] Idea could not be innovative, for example during the development another company might release a similar software.	
	\item[Lack of fundings:] Fundings might not be enough to develop the project.
