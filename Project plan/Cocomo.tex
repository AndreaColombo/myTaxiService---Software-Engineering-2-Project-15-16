\section{Cocomo}
We use cocomo model to provide an approximate cost estimation on the project and the time needed to develop the software.

\subsection{Effort estimation}
COCOMO formula for calculating the effort is $€ffort= 2.94*EAF*KSLOC^{E}$
Where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item KSLOC is kilo source lines of code calculated in the previous section.
	\item EAF: effort adjustment factor derived from cost drivers
	\item E: exponent derived from scale drivers
	\item 2.94 a parameter
\end{itemize}
We consider our project with all nominal Cost Drivers and Scale Drivers, thus EAF will be equal to 1 and E will be equal to 1.0997.
So €ffort = $2.94*1*4.081^{1.0997} = 15.3709809$ person-months

\subsection{Time estimation}
The duration of the project is calculated with the formula: Duration = $3.67*€ffort^{E}$
Where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item €ffort is the effort calculated in the previous point.
	\item E: exponent derived from scale drivers
	\item 3.67 a parameter
\end{itemize}
So Duration = $3.67*15.3709809^{0.3179} = 3.60379248$ months

\subsection{Conclusion}
Now the we have effort (expressed in person-months) and duration (expressed in months) we can calculate the number of people necessary to develop the software
$N = \frac{€ffort}{duration} = \frac{15.3709809}{3.60379248} = 4.26522365 \approx 5 people$. I decided to roundup to 5 to maintain a relatively large margin in case of problems.
