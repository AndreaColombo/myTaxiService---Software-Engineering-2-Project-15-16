\section{Cocomo}
We use cocomo model to provide an approximate cost estimation on the project and the time needed to develop the software.

\subsection{Effort estimation}
COCOMO formula for calculating the effort is $E= bKLOC^{c}$
Where KLOC is kilo lines of code calculated in the previous section and b,c two parameters that changes in relation to the nature of the project.
We will develop my taxi service basing on previous existing technologies, not from scratch, so it is safe to say that my taxi service belong to the organic class of projects.
For organic projects b = 2.4 and c = 1.05, so E = 10.75

\subsection{Time estimation}
COCOMO formula used to calculate the time needed to develop the software is $E = cKLOC^{d}$, where c and d are constants, for organic projects c = 2.5 and d = 0.38, hence T = 4.23.
